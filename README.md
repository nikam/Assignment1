# Assignment 1
We create basic interpreter for arith language than can handle addition and multiplication.

### Requirements to run the code:
1. Python 3.x
2. PyInstaller 3.x


Following are the requirements of the homework assignment:
1. An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of ARITH.
2. A parser for ARITH.
3. Interpreter for the AST.


### Extra Features:
1. Whitespaces are handled. No restriction on single white space.
